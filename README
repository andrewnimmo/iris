Iris is a CGI script, Exim MTA and Dovecot configuration files, Vagrant & Ansible
playbook, supplemented with instructions to build an e-mail server with virtual
domains support, authenticated SMTP relay, vacation, SMTP-time malware/spam/over-quota
reject, and web based account and domain administration, including domain-level
access control for delegated domain management.
Based on Exim MTA, Dovecot IMAP, MySQL, Perl.


1. Features

- Single server in this configuration is able to handle multiple independent
  domains with separate sets of users and aliases.
- Accounts maintenance is performed via web interface.
- Super-user(s) can modify everything. Selected users are allowed to modify
  domain(s) assigned to them, within limits set by configured quota.
- Malware is stopped at SMTP time by rejecting delivery instantly, the decisions
  are made by antivirus and antispam software, together with RBL.
- Accounts are monitored for space usage and e-mail delivery is deferred in
  case of over-quota condition.
- Vacation auto-responder is careful to whom and when it sends replies to and
  is end-user controllable via Roundcube vacation plug-in.
- IMAP/POP3 logins could be disabled for selected domain, but preserving accounts
  and uninterrupted incoming message delivery.
- In preparation to move particular e-mail domain to the server, the domain
  could be hidden from MTA, and then made visible on the flip of a switch,
  after initial configuration is performed.

The system is used in a medium size installation - 1000+ active e-mail
accounts - and proven to be reliable, low TCO solution.


2. System components

- Exim MTA http://www.exim.org/
- Dovecot IMAP server http://www.dovecot.org/
- MySQL database http://www.mysql.com/
- Any webserver with CGI support. SSL is recommended for security.
- Perl and some additional modules from http://www.cpan.org/
- Optionally, ClamAV antivirus http://www.clamav.net/
  and SpamAssassin antispam filter http://spamassassin.apache.org/

Tested with Exim 4.x, Dovecot 2.2, MySQL 5.5, Apache 2.2, Nginx.
All software components use standard distribution supplied install.


3. Limitations

- DNS setup is not discussed here and is a separate task.
- This is not an out-of-the-box software, you need a basic understanding how
  underlying components works: Exim, MySQL, etc. to be able to polish the
  install. Yet the supplied Ansible playbook will give you a ready to use
  FreeBSD based system.
- Webmail setup is not described, but Roundcube webmail is a recommended choice
  together with supplied vacation plug-in configuration.
- All information about the domain, its accounts and aliases is presented on
  one web page. This behavior simplifies programming and optimized for small
  to medium number of accounts in domain.


4. Upgrading

For additional instructions specific to upgrading to current version see
UPGRADE document.


5. Installation approaches

There are two alternatives:
- manual installation (described in details below, long and tedious);
- installation using Vagrant and Ansible to create complete VM.

As for the later: install Vagrant, Ansible, VirtualBox. Execute
$ vagrant up
in iris/ (this) folder to download base box (a Vagrant name for minimal prepared
VM image), and provision it with Ansible. The portsnap stage is a little bit
slow, but installation requires to build some ports with specific features.

After provisioning procedure successfully completes, please restart the VM with
$ vagrant reload
to apply new kernel parameters and start all services.

Visit:
https://192.168.33.10/rc/installer/ in a browser to initialize Roundcube database.
https://192.168.33.10/control-panel/ (mail administration panel)
https://192.168.33.10/rc (webmail)
Connect your IMAP client to 192.168.33.10:993
After webmail is configured, login as root and
$ chmod 0700 /www/mailhub.domain.com/rc/installer

Below are manual installation instructions.
If the instructions are unclear, then take a look at playbook.yml.


6. MySQL setup

- Create database to be used for e-mail accounts information:

mysql> create database mail default character set utf8;

- Create two database users - one with SELECT right for Exim and Dovecot, and
  another one with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE rights for iris.cgi and
  qwatch.pl:

mysql> grant select on mail.* to mail@localhost identified by 'password1';
mysql> grant insert on mail.greylist to mail@localhost;
mysql> grant select,insert,update on mail.expires to mail@localhost; -- for Dovecot expires plug-in
mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete on mail.* to iris@localhost identified by 'password2';

- Create tables and initial superuser account by executing iris.sql via mysql:
$ mysql mail < iris.sql


7. SSL

$ openssl req -new -nodes -x509 \
    -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Portland/O=IT/CN=mailhub.domain.com" \
    -days 10000 -keyout /usr/local/etc/mail.key -out /usr/local/etc/mail.crt \
    -extensions v3_ca


8. Exim configuration

Supplied exim.conf should be a good start for your setup.

You need to create a number of (empty) list files in exim config tabs/ directory.
$ cd /usr/local/etc/exim
$ touch aliases.global && mkdir aliases tabs && cd tabs &&
    touch host-reject ignore-dnsbl-hosts local-domains relay-domains relay-from-hosts

Note that 'vacation_reply' transport needs a directory to store history database
and the transport 'user' (smmsp) must differs from 'exim_user' (mailnull).
$ mkdir /var/spool/exim/vacation &&
  chown smmsp:mailnull /var/spool/exim/vacation &&
  chmod 2775 /var/spool/exim/vacation
Setup a cron job to purge old database files (crontab -e -u mailnull):
  2 1 */10 * * find /var/spool/exim/vacation -mtime +30 -print0 | xargs -0 rm
(add -r to xargs on Linux)

Setup root crontab to expiry greylist entries, expunge Trash-es, rotate logs,
and sync time:
  3 1 * * * echo "delete from greylist where record_expires < now();" | /usr/local/bin/mysql mail
  4 1 * * * /usr/local/bin/doveadm expunge -A mailbox Trash savedbefore 30d
  5 1 * * * /usr/local/bin/doveadm expunge -A mailbox Spam  savedbefore 30d
  6 1 * * * /usr/local/bin/doveadm expunge -A mailbox Junk  savedbefore 30d
  7 1 * * 7 /usr/local/sbin/exicyclog
  8 1 * * * /usr/sbin/ntpdate pool.ntp.org >/dev/null

Note, in case Courier IMAP compatible namespace is enabled in dovecot.conf via
'namespace { prefix = INBOX. ... }' then you must reference the mailboxes with
INBOX prefix. Ie. doveadm expunge -A mailbox INBOX.Trash savedbefore 30d


8. IMAP setup

Supplied dovecot*.conf files should be a good start for your setup.


8. Perl setup

Install additional modules:
- CGI::Lite
- DBI
- DBD::mysql
- Digest::HMAC_MD5

$ pkg install p5-CGI-Lite p5-DBD-mysql p5-Digest-HMAC


9. iris.cgi and webserver configuration

- Edit iris.cgi and change configuration variables. Probably change
  $html_start to use different CSS and <title>.
- Place iris.cgi in cgi-bin directory.
  CGI must execute with 'dovecot' UID to be able to create and remove maildir
  directories when account is deleted. For Apache 2.2 add to config:
  SuexecUserGroup dovecot dovecot
  <Directory /srv/http/iris>
      Options ExecCGI
      AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
      SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
      DirectoryIndex iris.cgi
  </Directory>
- Optionally configure SSL in webserver.


10. iris.cgi - admin web interface

- Point your browser to iris.cgi location and login with
  E-mail: admin
  Password: superuserpassword
  The account you just logged in is an initial superuser account.
- Create and delete domain by entering its name in textbox and pressing
  appropriate button.
- To manage domain select domain name in listbox and press Show.
- Every button on domain administration page work with corresponding
  section only. For example, you can't create and delete accounts in one
  step.
- Domain level settings allows you to change default authenticated SMTP relay
  policy for new accounts, to disable clients logins, and to hide the domain
  from MTA.
- To create account, enter information in following format:

account[,QuotaMB,FirstName,Surname,phone#,other email,other info]

  For example:

john
smit,20
someone,25,Some,One,+371 9xxx,secret@email.com,bla-bla-bla goes here comma,allowed
sparse,,,1234,,info

  Default quota is defined in iris.cgi.

- Create Aliases works similary. Format:

alias aliased,to,..

  'alias' should be name without domain. 'aliased,to' - email list. Name
  without domain part in 'aliased,to' list means user in the same domain,
  like traditional aliases file (user1@domain2.com,user -> user1@domain2.com,
  user@domain.com).
- To update or delete accounts enter new info or check a checkbox, then press
  Update. You can update and delete multiple accounts in one step.
- Toggle SMTP checkbox toggles authenticated SMTP relay for particular acount,
  ie. if it is disabled it will be enabled, if it is enabled it will be
  disabled.
- Toggle AV checkbox disable or enable antivirus and spamassassin filtering for
  account. AV filtering will be skipped if incoming mail has only one recipient
  with this flag set and no aliases expansion occurred before delivery.
- Aliases section works in similar way.
- To edit vacation settings click on account name. When you change vacation
  status between off and custom, then custom text is preserved, but the text is
  erased if vacation is set to default text. Vacation message is UTF-8 clean.
- To delegate domain management to the user, enter the list of managed domains
  into text area and set the quota. The quota will be shared across the
  specified domains and its usage will be updated even in case changes are made
  by other administrators or superusers. Only superuser can assign
  administrative rights.
- IMAP quota column may differs from Quota because maildir quota may lag behind
  real (database stored) quota which is updated by Exim at delivery time.
- "Inbox modified" column shows the date when MUA modified the Inbox folder.
  Technically, it is a modification time of maildir/cur/ directory.
- It is recommended to create a real domain and e-email account for superuser
  and delete initial superuser account and domain. At least change the password.
  As a security measure assignment of superuser rights to an account is only
  possible via mysql command line:
mysql> update accounts set superuser = 1 where account = 'account@name.here';


11. qwatch.pl - maildir over-quota monitor

If you want messages to over-quota mailboxes to be rejected at SMTP time you
may run qwatch.pl. Edit the script to change configuration and run under
dovecot user:
  $ su -m dovecot -c '/usr/local/sbin/qwatch.pl &'
At start it will read the state from MySQL database, re-check the state of
previously over-quota mailboxes, then it will run in infinite loop periodically
polling Exim main logfile for maildir over-quota messages, updating MySQL
'accounts.overquota' flag and checking reported mailboxes to be still
over-quota. Log file will be reopened when rotation is detected.
Additionally, it monitors log file for peers that repeatedly hammers the server
with messages larger than Exim message_size_limit (broken MUAs like Outlook) and
updates the database to disable authenticated SMTP for them. This is a DoS
potentially, so you can disable the functionality by commenting out $too_big_str
configuration variable.
